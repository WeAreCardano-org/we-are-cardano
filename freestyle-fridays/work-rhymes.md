## Become Virtuous

by Noah Jones

```
you call me arrogant but I get shit done
/ you say we can't change the problems but bitch we've got some
/ and you say that the way that it is the way that it is 
/ but what if the way it is is the way it is cuz you're making it the way it is
/ 
/ when I aim I aim for the fucking sky
/ I know I only get to live one time
/ so that's why I will fly before I die
/ and with my last breath I cry for help with this rhyme
/
/ the physicians lifting aren't lifting us up
/ treating their jobs just like games of luck
/ y'all do science like a parrot
/ repeating what your old boss told you
/ no idea of what makes merit
/ beneath the front you're just a fool
/ 
/ and it tears you up syndrome imposter
/ you ask society for a diagnosis
/ when it's actually true you fucking tosser
/ our work has a shit prognosis
/ we know you're lying in every experiment and presentation
/ there isn't a fucking scientist left in any nation
/ 
/ you went to school for grades and not to learn
/ just so you could show off your letters or have money to earn
/ but all I can see is a bunch of posers playing the game that keeps us down
/ that's why I'm coming up to turn the system upside down
/ while you keep us in the dirt
/ so fucking join me and I will show you what we are worth
/ 
/ as a species we have a responsibility to take the just way not the easy way
/ but even then I have some good news for you
/ 
/ when you understand the basics
/ you see like you just got LASIK
/ impossible problems seem easy
/ you make it all look breezy
/ 
/ we are cardano
/ we are cardano 
/ we are cardano
/ 
/ when we work together anything is possible

It's a work in progress.
