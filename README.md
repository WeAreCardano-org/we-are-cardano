# We Are Cardano

## Background

We need to support ourselves, the blockchain, and the community.

## Objectives

1. We need identities for voting so that voting is not proportional to votes.
2. We need a wallet that actually gives a correct assessment of the quality of different pools.
3. Ethics.

## Plan

### Generate a Bot

The bot has the name of WACBot for "We Are Cardano Bot." This is the
integer for bot permission 395405556800.

Below is an example that I am modifying.

```
{
    "name": "Req MToken",
    "type": 1,
    "description": "Request a membership token",
    "options": []
        },
        {
            "name": "user_name",
            "description": "User",
            "type": 5,
            "required": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Rap

```

you call me arrogant but I get shit done
/ you say we can't change the problems but bitch we've got some
/ and you say that the way that it is the way that it is 
/ but what if the way it is is the way it is cuz you're making it the way it is
/ 
/ when I aim I aim for the fucking sky
/ I know I only get to live one time
/ so that's why I will fly before I die
/ and with my last breath I cry for help with this rhyme
/
/ the physicians lifting aren't lifting us up
/ treating their jobs just like games of luck
/ y'all do science like a parrot
/ repeating what your old boss told you
/ no idea of what makes merit
/ beneath the front you're just a fool
/ 
/ and it tears you up syndrome imposter
/ you ask society for a diagnosis
/ when it's actually true you fucking tosser
/ our work has a shit prognosis
/ we know you're lying in every experiment and presentation
/ there isn't a fucking scientist left in any nation
/ 
/ you went to school for grades and not to learn
/ just so you could show off your letters or have money to earn
/ but all I can see is a bunch of posers playing the game that keeps us down
/ that's why I'm coming up to turn the system upside down
/ while you keep us in the dirt
/ so fucking join me and I will show you what we are worth
/ 
/ as a species we have a responsibility to take the just way not the easy way
/ but even then I have some good news for you
/ 
/ when you understand the basics
/ you see like you just got LASIK
/ impossible problems seem easy
/ you make it all look breezy
/ 
/ we are cardano
/ we are cardano 
/ we are cardano
/ 
/ when we work together anything is possible

## Progress

### Results

So far so good.

### Tasks

 - [x] Get the GitHub set up
 - [ ] Work on the GitHub website and the git book -- went with
       readthedocs
 - [ ] Ask Holger to please route people back into the community.
 - [x] Who are the VIPs and Advisors?
 - [ ] Worked on the We Are Cardano organisation. I need to create a
       membership system.
 - [ ] Speak to Kyle Solomon about food and hydroponics. (adosiawolf)
 - [x] Add relevant repos to the github.
 - [ ] Special interest group and voting blocks.
 - [ ] How do we engage with local government and improve administrative systems?
 - [ ] We need to get an on-chain representation of data.
 - [ ] Incentivize growth somehow.
 - [ ] Consider putting time bounties on project components. Ownership is proportional to time bounties earned over the sum of all time bounties. This will encourage more people to participate because it will make projects go faster without decreasing your personal share. The down side and up side is that it might discourage lower experienced individuals. There must be a balance.
