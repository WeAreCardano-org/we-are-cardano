# We Are Cardano

## Background

We need to support ourselves, the blockchain, and the community.

## Objectives

1. We need identities for voting so that voting is not proportional to votes.
2. We need a wallet that actually gives a correct assessment of the
   quality of different pools.
3. Ethics.

## Plan

### Generate a Bot

The bot has the name of WACBot for "We Are Cardano Bot." This is the
integer for bot permission 395405556800.

Below is an example that I am modifying.

```
{
    "name": "Req MToken",
    "type": 1,
    "description": "Request a membership token",
    "options": []
        },
        {
            "name": "user_name",
            "description": "User",
            "type": 5,
            "required": true
        }
    ]
}
```

## Progress

### Results

So far so good.

### Tasks

 - [x] Get the GitHub set up
 - [ ] Work on the GitHub website and the git book -- went with
       readthedocs
 - [x] Who are the VIPs and Advisors?
 - [ ] Worked on the We Are Cardano organisation. I need to create a
       membership system.
 - [ ] Speak to Kyle Solomon about food and hydroponics. (adosiawolf)
 - [x] Add relevant repos to the github.
 - [ ] Special interest group and voting blocks.
 - [ ] How do we engage with local government and improve
       administrative systems?
 - [ ] We need to get an on-chain representation of data.
 - [ ] Incentivize growth somehow.
 - [ ] Consider putting time bounties on project components. Ownership
       is proportional to time bounties earned over the sum of all
       time bounties. This will encourage more people to participate
       because it will make projects go faster without decreasing your
       personal share. The down side and up side is that it might
       discourage lower experienced individuals. There must be a
       balance.
